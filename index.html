                <H3>What Maketh a Banger? </h3>
                    <i>A screed by Becca.</i>  
                
                <p>
                    Humanity has been banging for eons, certainly. Yet a banger itself, it's atomic constitution, it's viscera, it's esoteric vibe…what maketh a banger? Tis but a simple query. For it is not if or under which circumstances one may bang, nay, a common mistake. <span class = 'highlight'>What maketh a banger?</span></p>
                    
                    <p>It is the cause and the effect. The quid and the pro quo. <span class = "highlight_other">The cat and, indeed, the bag it is let out of. </span>
                    To be a banger is no feat for small insignificant tracks. It is not only putting one's hands up, it must also be the declaration that they are playing one's song. <span class="highlight_other">It is not only the repeated supplication of if one has to, it is the bewilderment that one besought to linger. </span></p>
                    
                    <p>
                        How can such esoteric provocations be defined in the modern zeitgeist? <span class="highlight">The luddites will say they cannot be, yet the educated human will disagree vigorously.</span> Any human experience such as banger reception can be definitively qualified.

                <p>
                    Ask yourself, human, if you have experienced <span class = "highlight">any of the following symptoms associated with bangers:</span>

                    </p>
                    <ol>
                    <li>An incandescent wave of warmth spreading outwards from the point beneath your nose</li>
                    <li> Your human flesh hand <span class = "highlight_other">flexing into a claw</span> that clasps without warning upon the shoulder of a colleague</li>
                    <li> A primal vocalisation of <span class = "highlight_other">“ohh, hell yeah”</span></li>
                    <li> A <span class = "highlight_other">curiously robust urge</span> to make out with a rando</li>
                    </ol>
                    An affirmative answer to two of the above unequivocally constitutes exposure to a <span class = "highlight">certified banger</span>. Be joyous! Be free!</li>

                    <p>
                    One cannot help but be reminded of the immortal maxim of Bruce of New Jersey: “I'm on fire”. Such powerful words from The Boss. May it bring you inconceivable delight to revive <span class = "highlight">these bangers, these tokens of infamy, these gods of old, these unruly satyrs</span>. Use them to slight your enemies, betray your better selves, and most importantly, to make out with randos.
                    </p>
